# Advanced Data Journalism, fall 2019

Welcome to Advanced Data Journalism for the fall semester of 2019. You should have received a copy of the syllabus from the first day of class (ask Jenner for one if you didn't). The rest of the course materials will live in this repository.

## About the class

Advanced Data Journalism is designed to teach you the next level of skills you'll need to succeed in your data journalism careers. We assume that you already know the basics: tools like spreadsheets and databases and techniques around acquiring, vetting and finding stories in data. We'll review some of that, but mostly we'll focus on enhancing those skills — and introducing some new ones — through the use of computer programming.

Specifically we'll be working with the Python programming language, which is the most common language for data analysis, cleaning and manipulation in the newsroom.

This is not a computer science class. We'll cover some basic programming concepts, but our focus will be on applying our programming skills to solve journalistic problems. It's also not a data visualization class. We'll discuss that a bit, but we won't be diving deep into the tools needed to build those sorts of applications.

Think of it as CAR 2.0.

## Software requirements

We'll spend the first weeks of class getting your computers set up and familiarizing you with the tools we will be using in this class. You can find an installation guide for those [here](./class-software.md).
